It has come to my attention that there was an incident today during lunch that needs to be addressed.

I sat down and spoke with the individual in question and it seems as though we could not come to a mutual understanding.
Unfortunately this means that we are most likely going to have to release them from the company so everyone be prepared
to off-board Joshua Grahm sometime this week.
